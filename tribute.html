        Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and
        physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical
        experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental
        Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the
        United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a
        short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck
        out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his
        ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a
        range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC)
        induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by
        Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money
        and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company
        eventually marketed.

      <p class= "para">
        Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla
        conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators,
        electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a
        wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited. Tesla became
        well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to
        celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his
        showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his
        ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power
        distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in
        New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the
        possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to
        put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower
        project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power
        transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.[9]
        After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in
        the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most
        of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind
        unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work
        fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the
        General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic
        flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in
        popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.

        <li><strong>Moving to the United States</strong></li>
        <p class="para">
          In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the
          Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage
          the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New
          York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as
          well. In June 1884, Tesla emigrated and began working almost
          immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an
          overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists,
          laborers, managing staff, and 20 "field engineers" struggling with the
          task of building the large electric utility in that city. As in Paris,
          Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving
          generators.Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met
          company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times.[47] One of those
          times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all
          night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he
          ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their "Parisian"
          being out all night. After Tesla told them he had been up all night
          fixing the Oregon , Edison commented to Batchelor that "this is a
          damned good man".[44] One of the projects given to Tesla was to
          develop an arc lamp-based street lighting system.[49][50] Arc lighting
          was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high
          voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent
          system, causing the company to lose contracts in some cities. Tesla's
          designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical
          improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an
          installation deal that Edison made with an arc lighting company.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing</strong></li>
        <p class="para">
          Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting
          an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at
          Edison. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell,
          the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the
          patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and
          Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and
          utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light &
          Manufacturing. Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the
          patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents
          issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in
          Rahway, New Jersey.Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical
          press, which commented on its advanced features. The investors showed
          little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current
          motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up
          and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing side of the
          business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric
          utility. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company
          and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the
          patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in
          exchange for stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs
          and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla recounted
          that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing "My high education in
          various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me
          like a mockery"
        </p>
        <li><strong>AC and the induction motor</strong></li>
        <p class="para">
          In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union
          superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. The two
          men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions
          and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla's new ideas for
          electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, they
          agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents.
          Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an
          agreement that profits from generated patents would go ⅓ to Tesla, ⅓
          to Peck and Brown, and ⅓ to fund development.[68] They set up a
          laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he
          worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors,
          generators, and other devices. In 1887, Tesla developed an induction
          motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that
          was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its
          advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used
          polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn
          the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882).
          This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple
          self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding
          sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and
          replacing mechanical brushes. Along with getting the motor patented,
          Peck and Brown arranged to get the motor publicized, starting with
          independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement,
          followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles
          to run concurrently with the issue of the patent. Physicist William
          Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine
          editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his
          AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical
          Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric &
          Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a
          viable AC motor and related power system—something Westinghouse needed
          for the alternating current system he was already marketing.
          Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar
          commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor
          developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian
          physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would
          probably control the market.

      <h2>Death</h2>
      <p class="para" >
        In the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla
        left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral
        and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of
        blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and
        was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of
        his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries
        was never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong
        custom, and never fully recovered. On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86,
        Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was
        later found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered Tesla's room,
        ignoring the "do not disturb" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two
        days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body
        and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis. Two
        days later the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the Alien
        Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings.[26] John G. Trump, a
        professor at M.I.T. and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a
        technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in
        to analyze the Tesla items, which were being held in custody.[26] After
        a three-day investigation, Trump's report concluded that there was
        nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating:
        [Tesla's] thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were
        primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional
        character often concerned with the production and wireless transmission
        of power; but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods
        for realizing such results.[231] In a box purported to contain a part of
        Tesla's "death ray", Trump found a 45-year-old multidecade resistance
        box. Gilded urn with Tesla's ashes, in his favorite geometric
        object, a sphere (Nikola Tesla Museum, Belgrade) On 10 January 1943, New
        York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a eulogy written by
